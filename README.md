# iip2022-i-saw-him

This is a project for my Introduction to Image Processing class. The images I used were of my Professor, Gino Borja, who so kindly allowed me to play around with his pictures in this blog.

The narrative is that of an obssessive girl who sees a boy, from afar, and proceeds to fall crazily in love with him. Emphasis on the crazily.

I've titled this project: I Saw Him From Afar.

I hope you enjoy it!

I would like to thank the following people who have provided support, knowingly and unknowingly, moral and emotional:

Gino Borja, who taught me everything I know (in image processing)

Jephraim Manansala, whose own blogs helped me finish the machine learning portion of this project

Hipolito Punzalan III (or Hips, as we like to call him), for pointing me in the right track

Antonio Fernando (this is Toby), for being late with me, relieving some of the pressure


Thank you!
